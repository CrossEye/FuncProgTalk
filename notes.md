Notes for FP Talk
=================

* Consider using [Michael Feather's quote][mf1]: 

    OO makes code understandable by encapsulating moving parts.  FP makes code 
    understandable by minimizing moving parts.

* Definitely reference Steve Yegge's post, [Execution in the Kingdom of 
  Nouns][sy1].  Possibly make verbs-versus-nouns central theme.

* Alternately, focus on OOP as tight coupling between data and operations, FP
  as building functional abstractions from common functions over similar types
  of data.
