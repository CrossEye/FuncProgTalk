	<h2>What is Functional Programming?</h2>
    <div class="slide">
        <h3>No Single Definition</h3>
        <p>There is no clear, widely-accepted definition of Functional Programming.  It is a collection of
           related featues which cohere well into a very useful style of programming.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some of these features are readily available in Javascript.</li>
            <li>Others can be used if care is taken.</li>
            <li>And some are essentially impossible at the language level.</li>
        </ul>

<!--
The central tenet of FP is that data is only loosely coupled to functions. You can write different operations on the
same data structure, and the central model for abstraction is the function, not the data structure. Functions hide their
implementation, and the language’s abstractions speak to functions and they way they are combined or expressed, such as
generic functions or combinators.

The central activity in FP is writing new functions

    <h2>Chief difference between OOP and FP</h2>
    <p>Reg Braithwaite has a <a href="http://raganwald.com/2013/04/08/functional-vs-OOP.html">good description</a>
       of the central difference between these two paradigms:</p>
    <div class="slide">

            <h3>Object-Oriented</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Data and the operations upon it are tightly coupled</li>
                <li>Objects hide their implementation of operations from other objects via their interfaces</li>
                <li>The central model for abstraction is the data itself</li>
                <li>The central activity is composing new objects and extending existing objects by adding new methods
                    to them</li>

        <li class="slide">Lazy Evaluation (Miranda, Haskell)</li>

        <hr/>
        <p>We will take a look a brief look at these functional programming features of other languages first, then turn
           our focus to those things we can actually accomplish in Javascript.</p>
    </div>
</section>

<section class="slide">
    <h2>Shared Example</h2>
    <p>Following an example from <a href="http://paulbarry.com/articles/2009/08/30/tail-call-optimization">Paul Barry</a>
       we will use the example of the chances of winning a lottery.  This calculates the odds of choosing the correct
       `n` numbers out of the `p` possibilities.</p>
    <p>Here is an iterative version of the code:</p>
    <div>
        <textarea  class="code" mode="javascript" style="display: none;" runnable="false">function odds(n, p) {
    var acc = 1;
    for(var i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        acc *= (n - i) / (p - i);
    }
    return acc;
}

console.log(odds(3, 10)); //=> (3/10) * (2/9) * (1/8) => (1/120) => 0.008333...</textarea>
    </div>
    <br/>
</section>

<section class="slide">
    <h2>Recursive Version</h2>
    <p>This is similar, but written recursively:</p>
    <div><textarea class="code" mode="javascript" style="display: none;" runnable="false">// Recursive version

function odds(n, p) {
    return (n == 0) ? 1 : (n / p) * odds(n - 1, p - 1);
}</textarea></div>

    <div class="slide">
        <br/>
        <p>There are many reasons that functional programmers prefer recursion, but one very simple one is that
           recursive functions are often much more elegant than their iterative cousins.  It's easier to reason
           about them.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
        <p>Unfortunately, they often don't perform as well.  All the overhead of creating stack contexts for
           function calls tends to add up.  But certain kinds of recursive calls <em>can</em> be easily optimized.</p>
    </div>
</section>

<section class="slide">
    <h2>This code in tail-call formulation:</h2>
    <div><textarea  class="code" mode="javascript" style="display: none;" runnable="false">var odds = (function(){
    var odds1 = function(n, p, acc) {
        return (n == 0) ? acc : odds1(n - 1, p - 1, (n / p) * acc);
    }

    return function(n, p) {
        return odds1(n, p, 1)
    }
})();</textarea></div>
    <div class="slide">
        <br/>
        <p>Note that the recursive call in <code>odds1</code> is the last statement in its branch of the function.
           If this is true for all recursive calls, then the function is <code>tail-recursive</code>, and the
           compiler can replace the entire set of nested calls with simple <code>JUMP</code> operations.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
        <p>Such optimizations are required by many functional languages.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
        <p>This is slated to become required in the next version of the specification for Javascript, but it won't
           be consistently available client-side for some time.</p>
    </div>
</section>

<section class="slide">
    <h2>Pattern Matching</h2>
    <p>Some languages make use of an interesting techniqe to define functions: pattern matching.  Rather than use
       <code>if-blocks</code> in the body of the function, parameter-matching is used to choose which of a collection
        of related functions should be called.  Here we can see it in Haskell.</p>
    <div class="slide">
        <h3>Simple recursive version</h3>
        <div><div class="code" mode="erlang" style="display: none;">odds(0, _) -> 1;

odds(N, P) -> (N / P) * odds(N - 1, P - 1).</div></div>

    </div>
    <div class="slide">
        <h3>Tail-call version</h3>
        <div><div class="code" mode="erlang" style="display: none;">-export([odds/2]).

odds(N, P) -> odds(N, P, 1).

odds(0, _, Acc) -> Acc;

odds(N, P, Acc) -> odds(N - 1, P - 1, (N / P) * Acc).</div></div>
    </div>

</section>

<section class="slide">
    <h2>Lazy Evaluation</h2>
    <p>Many of us are most familiar with languages that evaluate their expressions as soon as they're encountered.  But
       there are some that wait until the last possible instant.  This can have some real benefits.</p>
    <div class="slide">
        <p>We'll switch example here, as there's not much call to do lazy evaluation for lottery odds.  We will follow a
           <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/284180/1243641">Haskell example</a> from Chris Eidhof</p>
        <div><div class="code" mode="haskell" style="display: none;">quickSort [] = []
quickSort (x:xs) = quickSort (filter (< x) xs)
                   ++ [x]
                   ++ quickSort (filter (>= x) xs)

minimum ls = head (quickSort ls)</div></div>
        <p>Note that the right half of quicksort is not calculated in finding the minimum.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="slide">One <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2165370/1243641">very interesting comparison</a> is that
       lazy evaluation is to the CPU what garbage collection is to memory.  The garbage collector allows you to pretend
       that you have infinite memory; lazy evaluation allows you to pretend that you have infinite processing power.</p>
    <p class="slide">But there are many reasons to like lazy evaluation.  It allows you to operate on theoretically
       infinite data structures, calculating only those parts you need.  And it allows you to define your own control
       efficient control structures inside the language instead of only at the level of the language syntax.</p>
</section>

<section class="slide">
    <h2>Homoiconicity</h2>
    <div class="slide">
        <p>No groaning.  At one time you had to learn what <em>polymorphism</em> meant, too!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
        <h3><em>homoiconicity</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><em>homo</em>: from the Greek <em>homo</em>, same</li>
            <li><em>icon</em>: from the Greek <em>eikon</em>, likeness, image, portrait</li>
            <li><em>icity</em>: from the Greek <em>icit</em>, extra letters to make words more pretentious</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</section>

<section class="slide">
    <h2>Homoiconicity in LISP-like languages</h2>
    <p>Homoiconicity has to do with the fact that in some languages, programs are written in a format easily
       interpreted also as a data structure.  In Scheme, the following is just a quoted list of three items,
       <code>define</code>, <code>(square x)</code> (itself a list), and <code>(* x x)</code> (another list)</p>
    <div>
        <div class="code" mode="scheme" style="display: none;">'(define (square x) (* x x))</div>
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
        <br/>
        <p>But the following is a function definition:</p>
        <div>
            <div class="code" mode="scheme" style="display: none;">(define (square x) (* x x))</div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
        <p>LISP-like languages can use this feature to build very powerful domain-specific languages.  Many would
           claim that this is the key feature that has allowed LISP to become the oldest language still in widespread
           use.</p>
